# PalmHill.LlmMemory Project

## Introduction

The PalmHill.LlmMemory project is an innovative C# application designed to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) through Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach integrates advanced memory management and data retrieval techniques to support serverless architectures and kernel memory operations. The project consists of:

- **ServerlessLlmMemory.cs**: This pivotal class manages the memory and retrieval processes.

The PalmHill.LlmMemory project aims to provide robust, scalable solutions for enhancing the capabilities of LLMs, making them more efficient in retrieving and generating contextually rich content.
