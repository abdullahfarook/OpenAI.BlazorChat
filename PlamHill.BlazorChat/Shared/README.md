# PlamHill.BlazorChat.Shared

This project is part of the PlamHill.BlazorChat solution. It contains shared models and extensions used across the solution.

## Models

### ChatMessage

This class represents a chat message in a conversation. It has two properties:

- **Role**: The role of the entity that generated the message. It can be either `User` or `Assistant`. The `User` role represents a message generated by a user, while the `Assistant` role represents a message generated by an assistant.
- **Message**: The content of the message.

### ChatConversation

This class represents a chat conversation. It has three properties:

- **SystemMessage**: The system message for the chat conversation. This is a message that sets the context for the conversation.
- **ChatMessages**: The chat messages for the chat conversation. This is a list of `ChatMessage` objects that represent the messages in the conversation.
- **Settings**: The inference settings for the chat conversation. This is an `InferenceSettings` object that controls the behavior of the inference.

### InferenceSettings

This class represents the settings for inference with a large language model. It has several properties:

- **Temperature**: Controls the randomness of the output. Higher values make the output more random, while lower values make the output more deterministic.
- **MaxLength**: The maximum number of tokens that the model will generate.
- **TopP**: The nucleus sampling parameter that controls the size of the token set considered for generation at each step. Lower values make the output more focused, while higher values make it more diverse.
- **FrequencyPenalty**: Discourages the model from using frequent tokens. Higher values increase the penalty, while lower values decrease it.
- **PresencePenalty**: Discourages the model from using new tokens. Higher values increase the penalty, while lower values decrease it.

## Extensions

### ChatExtensions

This static class provides an extension method for the `ChatConversation` class:

- **ToOrcaPromptString**: This method converts a `ChatConversation` object into a string format suitable for Orca. Here's an example of how to use it:

```csharp
ChatConversation conversation = new ChatConversation();
// Add messages to the conversation...
string prompt = conversation.ToOrcaPromptString();
